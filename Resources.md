**-----------------------------------Firebase and Flutter project connectivity----------------------------**

**they made a chat app by max in udemy course. it's in my firevbase/my_chat_app in training folder. The UIs for chat were from shubham in chatgpt. It covered all the firebase services..authentication, cloud storage and firestore, push notifications, build and publish. They added app icon and splash screen also in this. Later added named routes and also used services and providers. Can create a provider for all th above tasks .. share this code for reference to see how provider and services and models are used in the chat app- https://github.com/duytq94/flutter-chat-demo/tree/master


has all firebase services --- https://medium.com/firebase-tips-tricks/how-to-use-firebase-cloud-messaging-in-flutter-a15ca69ff292... 

**my reference - Don't do this codelab as it uses firebase UI and goRouter. which setsup with firebase cli and covers authentication and cloud storage but it us... Codelab firebase authentication and firestore - https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter#4**

Firebase offers many services...authentication, cloud Firestore(for No Sql database), realtime database(uses relational database sql..old), cloud storage(for storing users data like images, videos, etc), etc.

You can connect your flutter project manually or with cli tools. once tools are installed you dont need to install them again. next time only start with command 'flutterfire configure'

**steps to connect with firebase. This is latest through firebase cli**

1. Create a firebase project ---- from "goto console" tab at this link https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android

2. Create your flutter app in android studio and connect it to firebase project. Latest is using the Firebase cli... Follow steps at this link. Do till step 3 at this link...https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android......you need to install firbase cli first.....This is needed for flutterfire CLI..The FlutterFire CLI is a useful tool which provides commands to help ease the installation process of FlutterFire across all supported platforms.

   The flutterfire configure workflow does the following:
   
     * Asks you to select the platforms (iOS, Android, Web) supported in your Flutter app. For each selected platform, the FlutterFire CLI creates a new Firebase app in your Firebase project.
     * Creates a Firebase configuration file (firebase_options.dart) and adds it to your lib/ directory.
     * (for Crashlytics or Performance Monitoring on Android) Adds the required product-specific Gradle plugins to your Flutter app.

You can select either to use an existing Firebase project or to create a new Firebase project. If you already have apps registered in an existing Firebase project, the FlutterFire CLI will attempt to match them based on your current Flutter project configuration.

Asks you to select the platforms (iOS, Android, Web) supported in your Flutter app. For each selected platform, the FlutterFire CLI creates a new Firebase app in your Firebase project.

You can select either to use an existing Firebase project or to create a new Firebase project. If you already have apps registered in an existing Firebase project, the FlutterFire CLI will attempt to match them based on your current Flutter project configuration.

4. Now to use the firebase services in flutter app conveniently, we can use flutterfire. FlutterFire is a set of Flutter plugins which connect your Flutter application to Firebase e.g. plugins from pub dev. the 'firebase_core' package is always required for all the  features. To know about the plugins for diff features, scroll down at the above link to see the feature and the plugin. click on feature e.g. authentication and install the 'firebase_auth' and follow the instructions. same for cloud storage and storage.

5. While following the above guide..step 3...> step4 is like this:


    void main() {
  Future<void> main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await Firebase.initializeApp(
      options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
    );
    runApp(const App());
  }
}
 
6. Share this link for documentation on all the firebase services.. https://firebase.google.com/docs/build?authuser=0

  


**--------------------Authentication Flow with Flutter---------------------------------------**
 1.  Add the flutter_auth plugin and import
  
 2. Refer to this link for APIs .. https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart?authuser=0 , select android tab....and respective flutter plugins docs in pub.dev .... also (deprecated) https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview
  
 3. Enable with Email and password on firebase project
  
 4. Call createwithEmailAndPassord() for signing in and signInWithEmailAndPassord() for logging in. These methods return UserCredentials, which has user and the uid.

3. My reference - https://medium.flutterdevs.com/using-firebase-firestore-in-flutter-b0ea2c62bc7
  

**--------------------------Using Cloud Storage to upload image in form----------------**
1. Add the flutter_storage package
2. Use image_picker to take image from camera and show preview in form circleavatar widget. No need to store this image on device as we will upload it. Image should be in File format.
3. In firebase project, select Storage, production/test mode, set security rules.
3. Get the storage reference by creating a Firestorage instance, then ref, then child for folder, again child for file. File name can be usercredentials.user.uid.jpg, to give it a unique name.
4. Upload file by calling the putFile() method with the storage reference and passing the image file.
5. You can get the downloage url by calling the getDownloadURL() method with storage reference.
6. Share this link for image picker and upload  https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-upload-to-firebase-storage-with-flutter
  
  

**--------------------------Using Cloud Firestore as database----------------**
1. You use cloud firestore, which is a No SQL database. It has collections/documents. By default, each document is under auto genetrated id but you can give yours too. we can pass the uid of the authenticated user.
2. In firebase, go to project, select cloud Firestore. switch to native mode, set secutity rules.
3. Add the respective flutter plugin and import. 
4. create instance of this plugin, and call methods to create a reference to collections path and call the add() method for auto generated document id or create a collections/documents reference and call set() for setting a unique document id

**---------------------Push Notifications and local notifications -----------------------------------**
Push notification service has many methods for showing notification in ackground, foreground, just in system tray , as a pop up, pop up with data, etc. So some links talk about these methods while some also tell how we can send the device token through http request so that notifications come on their onwn when some thing change sin database for example a new chat msg came, rather than we testing them in the firebase console by copying pastting the token. Max uses firebase functions for this, but its a paid service. so http request can be made for this.
  
  Local notifications are used for some services like showing a pop up, etc(check it)..so the given link uses all
    
Give them this to add notifications in the chat app only that is using firebase services..sending notification did not work bcos of API so get one from firebase and use it. his was not working.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUU6gbDni4Q

**----------------Adding App Icon and changing app name- this shalll be part of publishing. refer to flutter official docs...can do  manually as angela did but now can be done with package.---------------------------**
  
 Using the package .. share this ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMHbgIgJyUQ&list=PL1WkZqhlAdC8uEd4SwmMD8_Bi_oCnwC4I&index=16&t=21s -- nice video......for android specific shape, go to https://icons.learnpainless.com/icons-

Its alos tells about changing the app name.
  
(FOR MY REFRENCE)
1. https://blog.logrocket.com/create-adaptive-icons-flutter-launcher-icons/ (using package --can give this too , if needed.. it rightly for both android and ios)...can refer to it
2. Manually creating your own icons and using them from angela udemy course using. Remove the previous ones b4 doing this. take any image from google and create icons using android image asset tool. and then add them.



**--------------------Adding the splash screen--- this shalll be part of publishing. refer to flutter official docs ---------------------**
**Using this package Does not support animation. Points to remember --- **

  Share thiis...
  
  1. package name - https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash
  
  2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB0dOnc2k10 (do this)
  

  1. It ran on Pixel 2 API 29..Android 10 device. Tested with color and image properties
  
  2. Added package from terminal as it had certain version conflicts so this command resolved them
  
  3. Used flutter_native_splash: ^2.3.0 version
  
  4. first gave command 'flutter clean' to clean the build cache in android folder. Then gave command flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
  
  5. Restarted the app, it worked
  
  6. For android 12 device, i.e api 31, did not test it. but also added it like this with their values
  
  android_12:
    color: 
    image:
  
  7. In order to support the Android 12 SplashScreen API, you need to:
    Update the AndroidÂ compileSdkVersionÂ to 31 in theÂ /android/app/build.gradleÂ file, and
    Update theÂ ext.kotlin_versionÂ to the latest Kotlin extension version (1.8.0 at the time of publication) in theÂ /android/build.gradleÂ file.
 
  
3. For errors in splash screen, check this link
my ref... https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/main/android_splash_screen/images (FOR MY REFERENCE)
4. **Animated logo on splash screen** ---do only if taught animation - package for animation is also there. we can see blog by log rocket also -  my ref... https://blog.logrocket.com/make-splash-screen-flutter/
5. **Doing manually -- don't do**
my ref... https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/splash-screen?tab=android-splash-alignment-kotlin-tab (official docs)
6. **Official docs** - https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/splash-screen 
  
  
************************* Building the app ******************************

2. Steps : 
  . Testing - to test it on a variety of devices/screen sizes, older devices based on which devices you need to support and real devices, if possible

2. Optimizations - e.g splitting widgets into smaller widgets, using const constructors, etc.

3. Set application name and identifier

4. Prepare all 3rd party services for production e.g. see that all 3rd party APIs are working, needed permissions are granted, security rules are setup, etc.

5. Add app icon and splash screen

6. Publish to app stores -- it did not publish to playstore as it's a paid service so published on android app store...they could download the app for its appstore and install it but it could not install on mine. But they could not download their app as it takes some time. For this go to official android appstore docs and follow the instructions,. for privacy policy create for free at this link. https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/ ... while publishing don't opt for test as its for sharing app for testing to ppl who test your app
  
7. i have max old videos also in training folder for this.

8. Share this .. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0GNuoCOtaQ ..   Also refer to official docs
