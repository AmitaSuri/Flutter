**Flutter is unique because:**
* **Flutter comes with its own customizable bundled widgets (including Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-styled) widgets).** 
  Flutter embraces composition to customize widgets. Widgets are built out of smaller widgets that you can reuse and combine in novel ways to make custom widgets. For example, rather than subclassing a generic button widget, RaisedButton combines a Material widget with a GestureDetector widget. The Material widget provides the visual design and the GestureDetector widget provides the interaction design.
  
* **Flutter is a reactive framework.**
  All the code of widget is defined in one flutter widget. When the widget state changes, such as user input and animations, the widget rebuilds itself according to the new state beacuse UI can be described as functions of State. The framework creates a difference to determine the minimal changes needed to update the render tree.
  
  This saves developer's time because the developer doesn't have to write extra code for solely updating the UI when the state changes.

* **Flutter uses its own GPU accelerated renderer.**
  Flutter's rendering engine is built in **Skia** (an open source 2D graphics library) and Dart. It displays widgets for both iOS and Androd devices.

* **Flutter uses Dart which supports JIT. This enables Hot Reload.**
  Debug mode builds use a Dart virtual machine (VM) to run the Dart code (hence the "debug" banner they show to remind people that they're slightly slower) in order to enable Stateful Hot Reload.

  The Dart VM has a just-in-time compiler (JIT) that enables Hot Reload. Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine (VM). After the VM updates, classes with the new versions of fields and functions, the Flutter framework automatically rebuilds the widget tree, allowing you to quickly view the effects of your changes.
  
  This saves time, otherwise needed for compiling the code, linking everything together, etc., each time a small change is made and the  applicaton is reloaded.
  
  Hot Reload works both on device and emulator.
  
* **Flutter uses Dart which supports AOT. This enables one codebase (both SDK Dart code and yours) to compile to native ARM code (i.e. machine code).**

  ![One codebase](https://github.com/walkingtree/images/blob/master/flutter/one_codebase1.png)
  
  When apps are ready to be deployed to production — whether you’re publishing to an app store or deploying to a production backend — you can use the Dart AOT compiler to ahead-of-time compile your app to native ARM code. Your AOT-compiled app starts instantly and runs smoothly.
  
  The AOT-compiled code runs inside an efficient Dart runtime that enforces the sound Dart type system and manages memory using fast object allocation and a generational garbage collector. 

* **Flutter's renderer is part of the app for consistent UI across platforms and devices**.
  Flutter does not use the system's OEM widgets. When the application is launched, the app loads the Flutter library. Any rendering, input or event handling, and so on, is delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code. This is where it's useful to have AOT compilation to native code. The iOS and Android devices just have to provide us the canvas to place our widgets on and the rendering engine inside.

  The renderer itself draws all its widgets so there's no need to bridge the UI to the native platform. Flutter can quickly render and re-render te widget tree, allowing rich animations are smooth scrolling.
